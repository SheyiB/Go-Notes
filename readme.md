# 🌟 Learning Golang Repository 🌟

This repository was created to **track my progress** as I embark on the exciting journey of learning the **Go programming language**. 🚀

I intentionally made the decision to start learning Golang on **April 1, 2024**. 🎉

## Decision to Learn Golang

## 📈 Progress

### Completed

### 🚧 In Progress

## 📝 Daily Learnings

This section will document my learnings day by day as I progress through the Go programming language.

### Day 1 (April 1, 2024)

- Learnt about the Go language. It was created by Google. Why? It was created to provide a programming language that is efficient, scalable and suitable
- How: it supports concurrency and parallelism improving performance.
- It makes use of light weight threads called Goroutines.
- It also includes garbage collection and allows low-level programming with ease
- It's simple to learn and read. It's also statically typed ensuring code safety
- It's also multiplatform and is compatible with a lot of cpu architectures
- It also features the Goformatter, and a testing framework
- Finally it's open source

- I had issues setting up Go on my Kali Linux. I'll try again tomorrow

### Day 2 (April 2, 2024)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

During my Golang adventure, I've encountered some fascinating concepts:

- **Go** is a statically typed language.
- It boasts built-in support for **concurrency**.
- The **simple and clean syntax** of Go makes it a joy to work with.

## 🌱 New Things Learned

Here are some nuggets I've picked up:

- **Short variable declaration**: A concise way to declare variables.
- **Type inference**: Letting Go figure out the data type for us.
- **Multiple assignment**: Assigning values to multiple variables in one go.
